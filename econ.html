                Originally from Oregon, John Francis Bray moved to England in 1822, living there for the next twenty years, working as a printer.  Bray's principal worker is Labour's Wrongs (1839), written at the bginning of the Chartist agitation.  Bray turned to the Ricardian labor exploitation thesis, and recommended the setting up of worker co-operatives in a communal property system.

            <p>
                Originally from Derbyshire, John Gray moved to London as a teenager, where he worked as a clerk in a counting house and trying to launch a commercial career, but was quite embittered by the experience.  In 1815, Gray moved to Scotland, to join an Owenite colony, but was disappointed there too.  He moved to Edinburgh at some point after.  Gray's death date is variously given as 1850 or 1883.

                John Gray's principal work is his Social System (1831). He was among the first to stress the human element in the destructiveness of competition.  As a substitute, he recommended co-operative institutions for exchange and production.

                One of its brightest and most eloquent of Ricardian Socialists, who peculiarly doubled as a free trade liberal anarchist and defender of natural rights individualism.

                Son of a storekeeper on the Chatham shipyards in Kent, Thomas Hodgskin left home at the age of twelve and enlisted in the Royal Navy.  He served during the Napoleonic Wars and retired as a naval officer on half-pay in 1812.  Fresh off the boat, he put out his polemical Essay on Naval Discipline (1813), a blistering attack on the press-gang, conscription and the lash, decrying the brutality and despotism of the navy as inconsistent with a free society and calling for far-reaching reforms in naval structure and operations.Hodgskin covered the parliamentary debate on the combination laws in 1824-25.  The state of the debate on the parliamentary floor prompted Hodgskin to publish his famous pamphlet,  Labour Defended, anonymously in 1825.  Here he took the Ricardian labor theory of value to its exploitation logic, arguing that labor was not only underpaid, but by being the source of capital itself, labor was also the best guarantor of private property and the prosperity of Britain.   His 1829 Natural and Artificial Rights of Property were originally published as newspaper letters Henry Brougham. His 1828 textbook, derived from his lectures at LMI, was perhaps the best English-language textbook in socialist economics at the time - even though he later became involved with the The Economist
